### Welcome to the powershell pipe

This demo is using the shell executor to test our python webapp.

Check out the original [repo](https://github.com/r3ap3rpy/gitlab-powershell)

You need to have [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.28.0.windows.1/Git-2.28.0-64-bit.exe) and [python3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) installed for this to work.

Rest is in the video.
